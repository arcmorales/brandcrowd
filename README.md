# Getting Started

1. Make sure your system has NodeJS installed. For this project, the node version used is v14.15.4. Version 14 is recommended as it is the current LTS.
2. Install all the node packages. Run `npm install`. You should find a `node_modules` folder in your project directory aftwerwards.
3. To launch the test runner, run `npm run cypress:open`. The test runner is useful as it allows you to view the application and see commands as they execute.
4. Click on `logoSearch.spec.js` to run the test.
5. Alternatively, to run the test in headless mode, run `npm run cypress:run`
